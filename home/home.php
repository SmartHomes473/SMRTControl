        home automation experience. Featuring:
        <ul>
            <li>Web control interface</li>
            <li>Open source design</li>
            <li>Minimally intrusive device networking</li>

        As long as a "smart" device abides
		by our platform's requirements, it can be added to your 
		ever-expanding list of devices in minutes - and can be controlled
		right from this web page. Take a look at our suite of demo devices
