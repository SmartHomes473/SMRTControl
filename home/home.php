	<!-- Blurb for the demo -->
	<p> SMRTHAUS is a platform that allows for a highly customizable
		home automation experience. As long as a "smart" device abides
		by our platform's requirements, it can be added to your 
		ever-expanding list of devices in minutes - and can be controlled
		right from this web page. Take a look at our suite of demo devices
		by using the navigation bar above, or check on the connection status
		of each device below. </p>
